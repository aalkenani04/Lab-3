# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_The Top bar is too thick, doesn't stay consistent scale, having one a different doesn't look_





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_The colour of the the graph is too contrasting with itself, there is no actual numbers to the data, and it's not ordered well, and some sections pop out._




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_They all overlap, the headings aren't informative, there's no key to tell us what the colours mean_




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Headings are too long, too dense with information, Y axis isn't labelled, Names of sections are very misleading, clearly biased_





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data? a wide format is when there are repeated values in the first column, a long format is when there are no repeated values in the first column.


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*? The staff data is a wide format.


How many observations are there in the data set? There are 55 observations




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- ___ %>%
#  ___(
#    cols = ____, 
#    names_to = "_____",
#    values_to = "percent"
#    )
